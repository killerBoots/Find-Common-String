# Find-Common-String
Find Common String Challenge

Challenge Description:

Given two strings X and Y (same no of characters), what's the longest string ()
that can be created such that it is common in both the strings? String ‘A' is 
said to be a child of a string ‘B' if ‘A' can be formed by removing zero or more 
characters from ‘B’. 

For example, PQRS and PQSR has two children with maximum length 3, PQR and PQS. 
We will not consider PQRS as a common because R doesn't occur before S in the 
second string. So the character order matters.

Evaluation: 

Input -> Two strings, x and y, with a newline separating them. All characters in 
upper case only.

Output -> Print the length of the longest string , such that  is a common in 
both x and y.

Please make sure that your program follows input/output format as prescribed above.
